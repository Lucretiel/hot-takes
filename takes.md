- Tracing GC is almost always unnecessary and designs that require it probably have fundamental architectural problems
- Functions that are only called once are an anti-pattern
- Function coloring is Good, Actually
- The hot/cold observable dichotomy is bullshit. *Event streams* may be hot (global) or not, but an observable doesn't do anything but describe what happens when you initiate a subscription.
- Garbage collection refers to any form of automated memory management, included reference counting and RAII. The common Garbage collection first implemented by Lisp and popularized by Java, Python, etc is Tracing Garbace Collection.
- Java is the Space Shuttle of programming languages
- While it's true that Rust is not a great first programming language, the problem isn't its complexity or novelty. Instead, it's simply because all the introductory material is written for someone who's already very comfortable with programming.
- A lot of the C++ implicit behaviors that it catches a lot of flak for are actually wonderful for preserving backwards compatibility and show their worth in old (10+ year) codebases
